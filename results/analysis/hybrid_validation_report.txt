HAAM FRAMEWORK: HYBRID VALIDATION REPORT
========================================

1. DATASET COMPARISON
   CREMA-D Samples: 2232
   IEMOCAP Samples: 10039
   CREMA-D Accuracy: 69.98%
   IEMOCAP Accuracy: 35.37%

2. STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE TESTS
   A. Accuracy Difference (T-Test)
      T-Statistic: 31.1605
      P-Value:     3.2161e-205
      Effect Size: 0.7292 (Cohen's d)
      Result:      SIGNIFICANT

   B. Emotion Distribution (Chi-Square)
      Chi2 Stat:   3595.0139
      P-Value:     0.0000e+00
      Result:      SIGNIFICANT

3. CONFIDENCE ANALYSIS
   Avg Confidence CREMA-D: 0.483
   Avg Confidence IEMOCAP: 0.671

4. CONCLUSION
   CREMA-D performance is significantly higher than IEMOCAP.
   This suggests the model performs better on short, single utterances than conversations.
